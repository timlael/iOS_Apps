No late submissions allowed since this is our final time.

Implement an app able to store a number of your friends, each friend has address, name. 
Name is unique. 
The app should allow to view your friends, add, delete, and modify. 
Add/modify invalidating uniqueness should be rejected.

The app will also allow you to set up a trip to visit some of your friends. 
For this, you need a way to select some friends to visit, and at minimum the app will display a map of St Louis 50km
resolution displaying the location of the friends to be visited as pins: name is title and address is subtitle. 
The map will also display your location, which can be hard coded.


The min requirements is 150 points.
You will get up to 100 additional points for other features. 
The project is 200 points (so the base gives you only 75%). 
Examples (non-exhaustive) of extra features: center over your friends and change resolution to show them all including yourself, 
compute the best order of visitation and display somehow possibly through pins, show the actual routes, 
allow specifying specific order of visitation, etc.
